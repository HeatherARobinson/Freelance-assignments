Notes on progress:

Start with hyp prep
Discuss how to confirm those posting internally
Confirm if those reporting ...Parameter Preview... rather than listing Old Parameters are intentionally not yet linked/redundant
Or if the parameters are timing out whilst loading and therefore are hidden from view

Functions checked:
Papermill_endpoint2 writing to basic_papermill_r_list_test.OUTPUT.ipynb








#Confirm- are all workers in prep in the hyp workbook?
#Are there still redundant workers in hyp workbook?

Redundant in prep:count_chronic_and_recent_hn_without_condition

#Hyp workers not linked to any output URL (excluding those posting to commands):
gnomeLogisticRegression (CN)

Review Hyp notebook for gaps:

n with and without fragility fractures empty
Some formatting errors with symbols e.g. na+. These may need wrapping within strings
patient record duration (start and end year) missing- extract with lubridate
all table 1 values set to 0- check with Mike/Cody this is as expected for the stage we are at
Within results section:
In results, case and control n missing
% excluded missing
Table 2 also empty needs populating
