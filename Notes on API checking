may noNotes on progress:

Start with hyp prep
Discuss how to confirm those posting internally
Confirm if those reporting ...Parameter Preview... rather than listing Old Parameters are intentionally not yet linked/redundant
Or if the parameters are timing out whilst loading and therefore are hidden from view

Functions checked:
Papermill_endpoint2 writing to basic_papermill_r_list_test.OUTPUT.ipynb
papermill_hl_clogit_local writing to home/jovyan/workshops/poison/xue/hl_clogit_local.OUTPUT.ipynb. 


#Confirm- are all workers in prep in the hyp workbook?
#Are there still redundant workers in hyp workbook?
#Confirm meaning of JSON {u'use_legacy_sql': u'True'}

#Template gaps from unlinked sources (may not be ready to link yet)
1.count case
2.count cases no fragility
3.ORs for chronic recent & combined
4.Dates study start and end
5.ORs for table 1 (from model 4)
6.% female
7.average age at fracture
8.SD average age at fracture
9.Adjusted ORs

#Hyp workers not linked to any output URL (excluding those posting to commands):

count_chronic_and_recent_hn_without_condition - feeds into 2? results correct not linked to output
stddev_age - results come out, not linked to notebook - feeds into 8?
gnomeLogisticRegression (CN)- no input or output- feeds into 5?
regression_recent_hyponatremia- no output, another logistic regression worker - feeds into 5?
regression_chronic_hyponatremia- input from final_case_control_set, no output - feeds into 5?
thiazide_history-no inputs or outputs- redundant?

Review Hyp notebook for gaps:

n with and without fragility fractures empty
Some formatting errors with symbols e.g. na+. These may need wrapping within strings
patient record duration (start and end year) missing- extract with lubridate
all table 1 values set to 0- check with Mike/Cody this is as expected for the stage we are at
Within results section:
In results, case and control n missing
% excluded missing
Table 2 also empty needs populating
