#Creating an SEM to describe the relationship between manifest variables and latent umbrella constructs

#To combine the 2 tofu datasets we have made some assumptions
#This is because Lavaan deletes an entire row if there is any missing data
#Texture and size are not given for flavored tofu so we have assumed a median texture (4) and size (2)
#There is no idencation of pack type for flavored tofu so I have omitted waterpack as a variable
#We assume none of the flavored tofu is produced offsite
#Flavor now has 13 levels, 13 being plain

#The variances across the variables need to be similar. We can scale them if they are not:
Tofu$season <- Tofu$season/10
Tofu$Texture <- Tofu$Texture/10
Tofu$Flavor <- as.character(Tofu$Flavor)
Tofu$week <- Tofu$week/100

#Each latent construct should contain at least 3 variables so that the latent variable can be estimated
#because the degrees of freedom are based on the variables, not on sample size.
#Do not construct a model that has 0 degrees of freedom

#Define the model:
# example: model<-'latent_variable =~manifest_variable1 + manifest_variable2 + manifest_variable3'

#So far seasonal looks good. All but week are over 0.9 for Std.all- standardised . Week is less relevant in predicting season.

#This first model won't converge because at least 2 latent variables overlap and need combining (matrix is not positive-definite)
#There are two few degrees of freedom to have latent constucts consisting of fewer than 3 variables-
#Size is now with Sales group in a variable called Presentation- because large sizes were only for retail and this corrected an overlap
#of what was being measured in Customer preference and Sales group.
#Shipping variables are now grouped with Sales area due to the correlations between Friday shipping and other site manufacture and distribution area
#Based on a 1 factor model of season I have dropped week as there is too much overlap with the other variables

#POSSIBLE ERRORS- "not positive definite"- the wrong classes have been specified. 2 may need to be merged. 1 variable may be a combination of others.
#Sales group resamples another latent class so needs to be merged. Won't merge with area

#If you have negative variances in std.all, set the variances manually in the model.
#e.g. other_holidays~~0.165*other_holidays






#The model can either be scaled by setting the variance of the latent variable to 1, and dividing this between the manifest variables
#OR we can set the variance of one of the manifest variables to 1 (more commonly used approach). This is the Lavaan default.

#Now fit the model (run a factor analysis to check how well the manifest variables explain the latent variable):

#Interpreting: Different manifest variables have different loadings on the latent variables.
#Std.all in the output shows these loadings. Close to 1 shows a strong relationship to the latent variable.
#0.3 is typically considered an acceptable loading.
#CFI and TLI should be between 0.9 and 1 to show that the model fits the data
