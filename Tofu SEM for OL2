Creating an SEM to describe the relationship between manifest variables and latent umbrella constructs
#Using the Lavaan package
#install.packages("ade4")      # PCA computation
#install.packages("lavaan") #SEM

Tofu<-read.csv("Tofu2.csv")
attach(Tofu)

#To combine the 2 tofu datasets we have made some assumptions
#This is because Lavaan deletes an entire row if there is any missing data
#Texture and size are not given for flavored tofu so we have assumed a median texture (4) and size (2)
#There is no idencation of pack type for flavored tofu so I have omitted waterpack as a variable
#We assume none of the flavored tofu is produced offsite
#Flavor now has 13 levels, 13 being plain

###########################################################################################################################
#Before running the SEM, run a preliminary PCA to guide model specification
#We are using the package ade4 because it has functionality for differentiating categorical and continuous variables.

#POSSIBLE ERRORS- "not positive definite"- the wrong classes have been specified. 2 may need to be merged. 1 variable may be a combination of others.

#If you have negative variances in std.all, set the variances manually in the model.
#e.g. other_holidays~~0.165*other_holidays


#The model can either be scaled by setting the variance of the latent variable to 1, and dividing this between the manifest variables
#OR we can set the variance of one of the manifest variables to 1 (more commonly used approach). This is the Lavaan default.

#Interpreting: Different manifest variables have different loadings on the latent variables.
#Std.all in the output shows these loadings. Close to 1 shows a strong relationship to the latent variable.
#0.3 is typically considered an acceptable loading.
#CFI and TLI should be between 0.9 and 1 to show that the model fits the data well
#Our CFI is 0.887 which show the model is a good fit as it is close to 0.9
